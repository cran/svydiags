Description: Diagnostics for fixed effects linear and general linear regression models fitted with survey data. Extensions of standard diagnostics to complex survey data are included: standardized residuals, leverages, Cook's D, dfbetas, dffits, condition indexes, and variance inflation factors as found in Li and Valliant (Surv. Meth., 2009, 35(1), pp. 15-24; Jnl. of Off. Stat., 2011, 27(1), pp. 99-119; Jnl. of Off. Stat., 2015, 31(1), pp. 61-75); Liao and Valliant (Surv. Meth., 2012, 38(1), pp. 53-62; Surv. Meth., 2012, 38(2), pp. 189-202).  Variance inflation factors and condition indexes are also computed for some general linear models as described in Liao (U. Maryland thesis, 2010).
